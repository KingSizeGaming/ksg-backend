    <h4>Uploading Your Work</h4>
    <p>
      The "Upload File" tab is your go-to for submitting your work. Here’s how
      you can use it:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Select the Game:</strong> Start by choosing the game to which
        your work belongs. This helps in organizing and categorizing your
        submissions accurately.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Upload a Single File:</strong> If you have a single file to
        upload, use the "Single File Upload" option. Click on the button, select
        your file from your device, and hit upload. It's that simple!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Upload a Folder:</strong> For multiple files organized in a
        folder, use the "Upload Folder" option. Select the entire folder from
        your device and upload it in one go. This keeps all related files
        together and saves time.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Tracking Your Submissions</h4>
    <p>
      The "Dashboard" tab is where you can keep track of all the work you have
      submitted. Here’s what you can do:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>View Submissions:</strong> You can see a list of all your
        submitted work by clicking Preview Asset, making it easy to review what has been uploaded.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Leave Comments:</strong> For any submitted work, you can leave
        comments. This is useful for providing additional information,
        clarifications, or any feedback related to the submission.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Managing Your Files</h4>
    <p>
      The "File Explorer" tab allows you to download files you have previously
      uploaded. Here’s how to use it:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Browse Files:</strong> Navigate through your uploaded files
        using the File Explorer. This tool is designed to be intuitive and
        user-friendly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Download Files:</strong> Simply click the icon next to any file you wish to
        download. This will save a copy to your device for offline access or
        further editing.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Important Notice</h4>
    <p>
      Currently, the "Assignments" tab is still under construction and is not
      operational. Please ensure all your file and folder uploads are done
      through the "Upload File" tab as described above. We appreciate your
      patience as we work on improving the platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      We hope this guide helps you navigate the app with ease. Should you have
      any questions or encounter any issues, please do not hesitate to contact
      our support team.
